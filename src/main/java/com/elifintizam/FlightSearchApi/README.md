# Flight Search API

Flight Search API is a backend api that I developed  by using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL for Amadeus Case Study.

### It has:
- CRUD operations.
- One way and two way flight search operation.
- A scheduled job that fetch flight data from mock api.
- Authentication.
- API documentation with Swagger.
